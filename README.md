### Description

I have decided to open source this for everyone to look at. if you use it in your apps please give me credit. it emulates a photoshop layer window and shows how to create a drag/drop/resizing designer form. There were numerous problems with original postings and i apologize for the wasted time. there seems to be some type of dependency issues, so if you still cant get this to run, leave a comment. as I am still in the process of developing this ,if anyone makes updates to this, i would appreciate it if they sent the file to me rather than post it here so i can incorporate the chnages, fixes into my master code that i will post when everything (everything) is complete. Eventually , there will be built in effects and filters and a whole lot more crazy stuff. anyway vote if you like it. BTW, this is not to illustrate image processing at all, it is a demonstration of controlling objects from User Controls. The example app is merely used to show the control in action.<BR><BR>thanks<BR>Ray

p.s. dont forget to regsvr32 the ssubtmr.dll first

<BR

p.s.s. dont forget to vote for me and remember this is still under heavy development
